Polysubstance use disorder, formerly called polysubstance abuse, is using more than one drug or substance at the same time or within a short period of time. You become [dependent](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6407-addiction) on these substances and follow a pattern of use that interferes with your ability to function, your health and your quality of life.

Mixing or combining substances isn’t safe. The effects it can have on your body are often unpredictable, and in many cases, life-threatening. Polysubstance use disorder is a treatable [mental health condition](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22295-mental-health-disorders). Help is available when you’re ready.

#### What is considered a polysubstance?

Any combination of drugs or substances would be considered polysubstance use. For example, drinking alcohol while taking [cocaine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4038-cocaine-crack) qualifies, as you’re using more than one substance.

**Are prescription medications a polysubstance?**

Yes, prescription medications can be polysubstance if you take them with other substances, even if they’re prescribed to you.

It’s very important to only take medications that your healthcare provider prescribes to you.

If you take medications as part of your daily routine, it’s important to tell your provider about all of the medications and supplements you currently take. Some drugs interact with each other. Your provider will choose medications that are safe for you to take and follow up with you to make sure you don’t experience any side effects.

## Symptoms and Causes

### What are the symptoms of polysubstance use disorder?

The symptoms of polysubstance use disorder vary based on substance type and amount. When you take substances, you may feel:

- Excited.
- Intense joy (euphoria).
- Relaxed.
- Sleepy.

You may experience the following symptoms when substances wear off (withdrawal symptoms):

- [Mood changes](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/mood-swings) (anxiety, [agitation](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/agitation), [depression](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9290-depression)).
- Muscle aches and [cramping](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21190-muscle-cramps).
- Difficulty sleeping.
- Sweating.
- [Diarrhea](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4108-diarrhea).
- [Nausea](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/nausea) and [vomiting](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/vomiting).

Common behavioral signs and symptoms associated with polysubstance use disorder include:

- Choosing substance use over social and personal responsibilities.
- Hiding substance use from others.
- Needing to use substances to function.
- Neglecting personal care (physical appearance, hygiene, eating meals).
- Showing hostility or denial when confronted about substance use.

Sometimes, it can be hard to recognize the signs and symptoms of polysubstance use disorder. A lot of people hide these patterns of behavior or adapt their substance use into their everyday lives.

### What causes polysubstance use disorder?

The exact cause of polysubstance use disorder isn’t exactly understood. But research suggests the addictive potential of substances and their effect on your [brain](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22638-brain) causes the condition.

Substances activate your brain’s reward system. They send chemicals ([dopamine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine)) through your brain that make you feel good. Your brain prioritizes these “good” feelings over healthy ones until you become dependent on them.

Many factors might make you seek out more than one substance. Common reasons may include:

- Achieving the desired effect of another substance that’s unavailable.
- Balancing/counteracting the effect of another substance. (It’s important to note that substances don’t actually have this effect, though it might seem like they do.)
- Preventing withdrawal symptoms.
- Prolonging or enhancing a high.
- Reducing how much of one substance you use by substituting it with another.
- Self-medicating or managing underlying physical or mental health conditions.

#### What are the types of polysubstance use disorder?

There are two classifications of this condition:

- **Intentional polysubstance use**: You take or use another drug or substance to increase the effects of another drug or substance.
- **Unintentional polysubstance use**: You aren’t aware that a drug or substance that you take or use was made or mixed with another drug or substance.
