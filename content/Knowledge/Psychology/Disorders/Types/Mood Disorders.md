A mood disorder is a mental health condition that primarily affects your emotional state. It’s a disorder in which you experience long periods of extreme happiness, extreme sadness or both. Certain mood disorders involve other persistent emotions, such as anger and irritability.

It’s normal for your mood to change, depending on the situation. However, for a mood disorder diagnosis, symptoms must be present for several weeks or longer. Mood disorders can cause changes in your behavior and can affect your ability to perform routine activities, such as work or school.

Two of the most common mood disorders are depression and bipolar disorder.

### What are all the mood disorders?

Mood disorders include:

- Depression and its subtypes.
- Bipolar disorder and its subtypes.
- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
- Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

#### Depression

[[Depression]] (major or clinical depression) is a common mental health condition. Depressive symptoms include feeling sad or hopeless. The condition can also cause difficulty with thinking, memory, eating and sleeping. For a person to receive a diagnosis of clinical depression, symptoms must last for at least two weeks.

There are several different types of depression, including:

- **[Postpartum depression](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9312-postpartum-depression) (peripartum depression**): This type of depression occurs during pregnancy or after the end of a pregnancy in [women](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/sex-recorded-at-birth). Women experience hormonal, physical, emotional, financial and social changes after having a baby. These changes can cause symptoms of postpartum depression.
- [**Persistent depressive disorder**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9292-persistent-depressive-disorder-pdd): This is a chronic form of depression that must last for at least two years. Symptoms may occasionally lessen in severity during this time. It’s less severe than [major depressive disorder](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24481-clinical-depression-major-depressive-disorder), but it’s ongoing.
- [**Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9293-seasonal-depression): This type of depression occurs during certain seasons of the year. It typically starts in the late autumn or early winter and lasts until spring or summer. Less commonly, SAD episodes may also begin during the late spring or summer. Symptoms of winter seasonal affective disorder may resemble those of major depression. They tend to disappear or lessen during spring and summer.
- **Depression with psychosis**: This is a type of severe depression combined with psychotic episodes, such as hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that others don’t) or delusions (having fixed but false beliefs). People who experience depression with psychosis have an increased risk of thinking about [suicide](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/suicide).

#### Bipolar disorder

[[Bipolar Disorder]] is a lifelong mood disorder and mental health condition that causes intense shifts in mood, energy levels, thinking patterns and behavior. There are a few types of bipolar disorder, which involve experiencing significant fluctuations in mood referred to as hypomanic/manic and depressive episodes.

There are four basic types of bipolar disorder, including:

- **Bipolar I disorder**: People with bipolar I disorder have experienced one or more episodes of mania. Most people with bipolar I will have episodes of both mania and depression, but an episode of depression isn’t necessary for a diagnosis.
- **Bipolar II disorder**: This disorder causes cycles of depression similar to those of bipolar I. A person with this illness also experiences [hypomania](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21774-hypomania), which is a less severe form of [mania](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21603-mania). Hypomanic periods aren’t as intense or disruptive as manic episodes. Someone with bipolar II disorder is usually able to handle daily responsibilities.
- [**Cyclothymia disorder (cyclothymia)**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17788-cyclothymia): People with cyclothymic disorder have a chronically unstable mood state. They experience hypomania and mild depression for at least two years.
- **Other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders**: Symptoms of this type of bipolar disorder don’t meet the criteria for one of the other types, but people still have significant, abnormal mood changes.

#### Other mood disorders

Other mood disorders include:

- [**Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd): This type of mood disorder occurs seven to 10 days before [menstruation](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10132-menstrual-cycle) and goes away within a few days of the start of the menstrual period. It’s a more serious form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Researchers believe this condition is brought about by the hormonal changes related to the menstrual cycle. Symptoms may include anger, irritability, anxiety, depression and insomnia.
- [**Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24394-disruptive-mood-dysregulation-disorder-dmdd): DMDD affects children and adolescents. It involves frequent anger outbursts and irritability out of proportion to the situation. DMDD is more severe than intermittent explosive disorder (IED), and anger is present most of the time, occurring before the age of 10.

### Is anxiety a mood disorder?

[[Anxiety]] isn’t a mood disorder. It’s classified as one of many [[Anxiety Disorders]], including panic disorder and phobias. However, anxiety often precedes or coexists with mood disorders.

### Who do mood disorders affect?

Mood disorders can affect anyone, including children, adolescents and adults.

Major depression is twice as likely to affect women.

### How common are mood disorders?

Mood disorders are relatively common in adults, with depression and bipolar disorder being the most common. Approximately 7% of adults in the United States have depression, while about 2.8% have bipolar disorder.

Mood disorders are commonly seen in children and adolescents — approximately 15% have any mood disorder.

## Symptoms and Causes

### What are the symptoms of mood disorders?

Each mood disorder has different symptoms and/or different patterns of symptoms.

Mood disorders typically have symptoms that affect your mood, sleep, eating behaviors, energy level and thinking abilities (such as racing thoughts or loss of concentration).

In general, depressive symptoms include:

- Feeling sad most of the time or nearly every day.
- A lack of energy or feeling sluggish.
- Feeling worthless or hopeless.
- Loss of interest in activities that formerly brought enjoyment.
- Thoughts about death or suicide.
- Difficulty concentrating or focusing.
- Sleeping too much or not enough.
- Loss of appetite or overeating.

In general, symptoms of hypomanic or manic episodes include:

- Feeling extremely energized or elated.
- Rapid speech or movement.
- [Agitation](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/agitation), restlessness or irritability.
- Risk-taking behavior, such as spending more money than usual or driving recklessly.
- Racing thoughts.
- Insomnia or trouble sleeping.

### What causes mood disorders?

Researchers believe several factors contribute to the development of mood disorders, including:

- **Biological factors**: The brain areas responsible for controlling your feelings and emotions are the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. People with mood disorders have been shown to have an enlarged amygdala on brain imaging tests.
- **Genetic factors**: People who have a strong family history of a mood disorder are more likely to develop mood disorders, which shows that mood disorders are likely partly genetic/inherited.
- **Environmental factors**: Stressful life changes, such as the death of a loved one; chronic stress; traumatic events; and [childhood abuse](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4018-child-abuse) are major risk factors for the development of a mood disorder later on in life, especially depression. Depression has also been linked to [chronic illnesses](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9288-chronic-illness-and-depression), such as [diabetes](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/14891-diabetes-stress--depression), [Parkinson’s disease](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8525-parkinsons-disease-an-overview) and [heart disease](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-protect-your-mental-health-after-a-heart-attack/).
