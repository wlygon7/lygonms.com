An anxiety disorder is a type of [mental health condition](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22295-mental-health-disorders). If you have an anxiety disorder, you may respond to certain things and situations with fear and dread. You may also experience physical signs of anxiety, such as a pounding heart and sweating.

It’s normal to have some anxiety. You may feel anxious or nervous if you have to tackle a problem at work, go to an interview, take a test or make an important decision. Some anxiety can even be beneficial — it helps us notice dangerous situations and focuses our attention so we stay safe.

But an anxiety disorder goes beyond the regular nervousness and slight fear you may feel from time to time. An anxiety disorder happens when:

- Anxiety interferes with your ability to function.
- Your reactions are often out of proportion to situations (overreactions).
- You can’t control your responses to situations.

Children, adolescents and adults can experience anxiety disorders. [Women](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/sex-recorded-at-birth) are about twice as likely as men to have one.

Anxiety disorders can make it difficult to get through the day. Fortunately, there are several effective treatments for these conditions.

#### Types of anxiety disorders

There are several types of anxiety disorders according to the American Psychiatric Association’s _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ ([_DSM-5_](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24291-diagnostic-and-statistical-manual-dsm-5)). This is the standard reference manual for diagnosing mental health conditions. Types of anxiety disorders include:

- [**Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23940-generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad): This condition causes fear, worry and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. It’s characterized by excessive, frequent and unrealistic worry about everyday things, such as job responsibilities, health or chores.
- [**Agoraphobia**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15769-agoraphobia): This condition causes an intense fear of becoming overwhelmed or unable to escape or get help. People with agoraphobia often avoid new places and unfamiliar situations, like large, open areas or enclosed spaces, crowds and places outside of their homes.
- [[Panic Disorder]]: This condition involves multiple unexpected panic attacks. A main feature of the condition is that the attacks usually happen without warning and aren’t due to another mental health or physical condition. Some people with panic disorder also have agoraphobia.
- [**Specific phobias**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24757-phobias): A phobia is when something causes you to feel fear or anxiety that’s so severe it consistently and overwhelmingly disrupts your life. There are hundreds of different types of phobias, and there’s one diagnosis for almost all of them: specific phobia. Only one phobia, agoraphobia, is a distinct diagnosis.
- [**Social anxiety disorder**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22709-social-anxiety): This condition (formerly known as social phobia) happens when you experience intense and ongoing fear of being judged negatively and/or watched by others.
- [**Separation anxiety disorder**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23142-separation-anxiety): This condition happens when you feel excessive anxiety when you’re separated from a loved one, like a primary caregiver. While separation anxiety in babies and toddlers is a normal [stage of development](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21559-child-development), separation anxiety disorder can affect children and adults.
- [**Selective mutism**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/selective-mutism): This condition happens when you don’t talk in certain situations because of fear or anxiety. It usually affects young children, but it can also affect adolescents and adults.

Other mental health conditions share features with anxiety disorders. These include [post-traumatic stress disorder](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9545-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd) (PTSD), [acute stress disorder](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24755-acute-stress-disorder) and [[Obsessive Complusion Disoder|OCD]]. But the American Psychiatric Association classifies them as distinct conditions and not anxiety disorders.

#### How common are anxiety disorders?

Anxiety disorders are some of the most common mental health conditions:

- Specific phobias affect up to 12% of the U.S. population.
- Social anxiety disorder affects about 7% of the U.S. population.
- Generalized anxiety disorder affects about 3% of the U.S. population.
- Agoraphobia affects up to 1.7% of the U.S. population.
- Separation anxiety disorder affects about 4% of children, 1.6% of adolescents and up to 1.9% of adults.
- Selective mutism is the least common anxiety disorder. It affects between 0.47% and 0.76% of the U.S. population.

## Symptoms and Causes

### What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?

Symptoms of anxiety disorders vary depending on the type.

Psychological symptoms may include:

- Feeling panic, fear, dread and uneasiness.
- Feeling on edge or irritable.
- Uncontrollable, obsessive thoughts.
- Difficulty concentrating.

Physical symptoms may include:

- Restlessness.
- [Heart palpitations](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17084-heart-palpitations).
- [Shortness of breath](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/16942-shortness-of-breath-dyspnea).
- Muscle tension.
- Cold or sweaty hands.
- [Dry mouth](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/10902-dry-mouth-treatments).
- [Nausea](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/8106-nausea--vomiting).
- [Numbness](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21015-numbness) or tingling in your hands or feet.
- Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep ([insomnia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12119-insomnia)).

It’s important to talk to your healthcare provider or a mental health professional if you frequently experience these symptoms.

### What causes anxiety disorders?

Like other types of mental health conditions, researchers don’t know exactly what causes anxiety disorders. But they think a combination of factors plays a role:

- **Chemical imbalances**: Several [neurotransmitters](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22513-neurotransmitters) and [hormones](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22464-hormones) play a role in anxiety, including [norepinephrine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22610-norepinephrine-noradrenaline), [serotonin](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin), [dopamine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine) and [gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22857-gamma-aminobutyric-acid-gaba). Imbalances in these chemicals can contribute to an anxiety disorder.
- **Brain changes**: A part of your [brain](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22638-brain) called the [amygdala](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24894-amygdala) plays an important role in managing fear and anxiety. Studies show that people with anxiety disorders show increased amygdala activity in response to anxiety cues.
- **Genetics**: Anxiety disorders tend to run in biological families. This suggests that genetics may play a role. You may be at an increased risk of developing one if you have a first-degree relative (biological parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder.
- **Environmental factors**: Severe or long-lasting [stress](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11874-stress) can change the balance of neurotransmitters that control your mood. Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period can contribute to an anxiety disorder. Experiencing a traumatic event can also trigger anxiety disorders.
