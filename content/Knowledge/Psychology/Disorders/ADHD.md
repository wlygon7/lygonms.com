ADHD is a developmental disorder characterized by an ongoing pattern of one or more of the following types of symptoms:

- Inattention, such as having difficulty paying attention, keeping on task, or staying organized
- Hyperactivity, such as often moving around (including during inappropriate times), feeling restless, or talking excessively
- Impulsivity, such as interrupting, intruding on others, or having trouble waiting one’s turn

It is common for people to show these behaviors some of the time. However, for people with ADHD, the behaviors are frequent and occur across multiple situations, such as at school, at home, at work, or with family and friends.
