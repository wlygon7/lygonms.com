Nearly everyone has felt depressed, sad, or blue at one time or another. A depressed mood is a normal reaction to loss, life's struggles, or injured self-esteem. Sometimes, however, depression becomes intense, lasts for long periods, and prevents a person from leading a normal life. If left untreated, depression can get worse, sometimes lasting for years. It can even result in suicide. It is important to recognize the signs of depression and seek help if you see signs of depression in you or a loved one. It is important to know that depression CAN be treated successfully.

### What are the types of depression?

Major depressive disorder (or major depression): A person with this type of depression feels a profound and constant sense of hopelessness and despair. The symptoms of major depression interfere with the person's ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy themselves, even activities which had previously been pleasurable. This disabling type of depression may occur only once in a lifetime, or more commonly, occurs several times in a lifetime.

Minor depression: A person with this type of depression has symptoms for longer than two weeks at a time, but does not meet the criteria for major depression.

Dysthymic disorder (or dysthymia or chronic depression): In dysthymia, the main symptom is a low mood on most days for a long period of time. Other depression symptoms may be present, but are not as severe as in major depression.

### How is depression diagnosed?

Your health care provider will ask you to describe your symptoms and medical history. He or she likely will ask if you or anyone in your family has had depression or other mental health problems. You also may need to complete a depression screening questionnaire. Symptoms of depression sometimes are caused by a physical disorder or illness. Your health care provider also may perform a [physical exam](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/appointments-and-questions) or laboratory tests to determine if there is a physical cause for the depression.

### Can depression be prevented?

Some individuals who have had an episode of depression are prone to have another one. The best way to prevent another episode is to be aware of the triggers of depression, know your own symptoms, and seek help early if you need it.
