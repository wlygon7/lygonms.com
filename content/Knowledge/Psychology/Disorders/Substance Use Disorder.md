Substance use disorder (SUD), formerly known as drug addiction, is a [mental health condition](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22295-mental-health-disorders) where you experience a problematic pattern of substance use that affects your health and quality of life.

[Substances](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/addictive-substances) change how your [brain](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22638-brain) functions over time. They release [dopamine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine), a chemical in your brain that makes you feel good — until the substance wears off. Your brain and body want to continue this good feeling, even if it’s unhealthy. It can significantly impact your emotional well-being, relationships, education and career. And in many cases, it’s life-threatening.

SUD exists on a spectrum and may be mild, moderate or severe. No matter where you are, know that this condition is treatable and help is available when you’re ready.

## Symptoms and Causes

### What are the symptoms of substance use disorder?

The symptoms and effects of substance use disorder vary based on the type of substance you use. There are two groups of symptoms based on when or if the substance is in your body. These include:

- [**Intoxication**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/intoxication): This is the immediate and short-term effect of a substance in your body. Symptoms include feeling sleepy, calm, excited, intense emotions, etc. The substance can also affect your judgment and decision-making or physical and mental functioning.
- **Withdrawal**: These are symptoms that happen when the short-term effects of a substance wear off and the substance starts to leave your body. Symptoms are unpleasant and could include [nausea](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/nausea) and [vomiting](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/vomiting), [diarrhea](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4108-diarrhea), sweating, difficulty sleeping, [muscle cramping](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21190-muscle-cramps) and [mood changes](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/mood-swings).

### What are the signs of a substance use disorder?

According to the American Psychiatric Association’s [_Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24291-diagnostic-and-statistical-manual-dsm-5), the signs of substance use disorder include:

- Taking the substance in larger amounts and for a longer amount of time than you’re meant to if it’s a prescription.
- Having a strong desire or urge to use the substance.
- Having unsuccessful efforts to cut down on or manage substance use.
- Spending a lot of time obtaining or using the substance or recovering from its effects.
- Having issues fulfilling responsibilities at work, school or home due to substance use.
- Continuing to use the substance, even when it causes problems in relationships.
- Giving up social, occupational or recreational activities because of substance use.
- Using substances again and again, even when it puts you in danger.
- Continuing substance use despite an ongoing physical or psychological problem that’s likely caused or worsened by the substance.
- Developing tolerance (need for increased amounts to get the same effect).
- Experiencing withdrawal symptoms, which can be relieved by taking more of the substance.

Seeking medical care as soon as you have signs of substance use disorder is essential.

### What causes substance use disorder?

The exact cause of a substance use disorder isn’t well understood. However, research shows that the changes to your brain’s reward system due to a substance’s addictive potential may cause the condition.
