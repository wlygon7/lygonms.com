Hello. I'm Wilson. I build things, take photos, play bass, and think too much about systems—both technical and theological. 

This is my digital garden. Some notes are polished, most aren't. It's messy by design.

## What I'm Into Right Now

- Building [[ANNA - A Neural Network Agent|ANNA]], a voice assistant that lives in a repurposed Dell laptop
- Running a [[Homelab|homelab]] that's probably overkill for a homeschooler
- [[Photography|Taking photos]] with my Canon 80D
- Playing bass and wondering why [[Music Theory|music theory]] makes my brain happy
- [[Lygon Studios|Making things]] across too many mediums

## Explore

The [[graph view]] shows how everything connects. Click around. Get lost. That's the point, have fun :)

Or start with:
- [[Things I'm learning]]
- [[Projects I'm building]]
- [[Thoughts I'm thinking]]
