(Please Note this is still in early development, and it will look jank for a while. I don't have a lot of free time to improve this site, but it will get improved).

**Hello. I'm Wilson.**

I build things, take photos, play bass, and think too much about systems—both technical and theological.

_Efficiency through curiosity, messiness by design._

This is my digital garden. Some notes are polished, most aren't. I follow the Zettelkasten method loosely—if it's important, it floats back to the surface. Life resists neat containers, and so do I.

## Now

- Building [[ANNA - A Neural Network Agent|ANNA]] a voice assistant that doesn't sell my data, lives in a repurposed Dell laptop, and is tailored to how I actually work—not how Silicon Valley thinks I should
- Running a [[Knowledge/IT/Homelab/index|homelab]] (Vega on Proxmox for basically all software such as gitea, azuracast, adguard and more, and Aphrodite hosting my co-op's (co-op is homeschoolers roleplaying public school, just google it) Minecraft server and my Nextcloud)
- Taking photos with my [[Canon80D.base|Canon 80D]]
- Playing bass, guitar, piano—occasionally wondering why [[Music]] (theory) clicks when formal math doesn't
- Teaching myself to code (web dev, mostly), [[3D printing]] prototypes, and trying not to start three more hobbies this week

## About This Space

I'm a self-taught, indecisive polymath who homeschools and freelances across too many mediums. The graph view shows how everything connects. Click around. Get lost. Find something weird. That's the point.

Have fun exploring. Come back if you want. No pressure.
